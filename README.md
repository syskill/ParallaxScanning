# Radar Synergy

This Factorio mod adds research to give vanilla radars a bonus to scanning range for each adjacent radar. As with nuclear reactors' neighbor bonus, the radars must be directly adjacent and aligned to each other to receive the synergy bonus.

The research is called "parallax scanning," and it has three tiers. At the highest tier, five radars arranged in a cross will have five times the scanning range of a single radar.

Tier | Synergy bonus | Maximum scanning range
---- | ------------- | ------------------------
1    | 25%           | ×2
2    | 50%           | ×3
3    | 100%          | ×5
